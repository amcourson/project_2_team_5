<strong>PROJECT TITLE:</strong> Event Planning 

<strong> MOTIVATION:</strong> <br>
The motivation behind this project was to create an app that lets users create events and see what events they are attending. We wanted an app where people could host events, see what events they are attending and also add what they want to bring to the event if there is a potluck or a gift registery. Project creation is for the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp 2020/2021
